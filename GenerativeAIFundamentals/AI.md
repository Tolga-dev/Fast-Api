## Generative AI

### Introduction

* ANI
  * artificial narrow intelligence,
    * weak ai
    * cant make independent decisions
    * learn new skills
    * developer deep understanding world
    * preprogrammed algos
    * data and requires muhan
* AGI
  * artificial general intelligence,
    * general, strong
    * can understand, appply
* ASI
  * artificial super intelligence
    * super intelligence

  * Use transformer architecture;

  * 
### Tokens
* llm break down prompts into tiny building blocks called tokens
  * token
    * single, unit of meaning in natural language
    * a whole word
    * smallest segment of a text 
    * bits of data
  * toneization
    * process of breaking down text data into tokens following certain predeterminedrules 
    * decoding human lang
    * make text data coppatible 
    * individual work, word toekn
    * parts of words, subword tokens
    * machine readable bytes, byte level token
    * individual char, char token
    * sentences, sentence token
    * other types
  * most used is word tokenization
  * max input, centain number of tokens in a single request
  * optimizing cost, number of token used
