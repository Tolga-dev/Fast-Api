* simple
* first
  * gets things started is requirement analysis
    * analytical phase
    * a set of requirements
* design
  * arch
  * database
  * tables
  * fields
* support
* Disadvantages
  * time
  * estimations difficult
  * dont be simple
  * too much doc
  * waiting
* analysis
  * requirement gathering
  * requirement specifications
* design
  * arch
  * db design
  * prototype 
* dev
  * code
* testing
  * test planning
  * preparation
  * issue track
  * conlusion
* release
  * app delivery
  * user acceptance
  * maintenance
  * support
* features
  * first process 
  * fully done to move next one
* when to use
  * requirement are clear and fixed
  * highly regulated area, government, military
* disadvantages
## Agile
* individuals and interactions
  * over processes and tool

  * over comprehensive doc
* customer collaboration
  * over contract negotiation
* responding to change
  * over following a plan

  * deliver software requently
  * business people and dev must work together
  * build project around motivated individuals
  * face to face best
  * worknig software primary
  * agile, promote sustainable 
  * continuous attention to tech and good design
  * simplicty essential
  * best arch, requ, designs from self organizing teams
  * more effective

      * planned
      * challenges if any
    * once a day
* scrum elemts other
  * burndown chart
    * right line
* artifact
  * product backlog
  * sprint backlog
  * product increment
* other 
  * release burndown
  * implement
  * sprint burndown
